   <summary><h3> üêõ My Journey from Tech Support to SRE  </summary>
      I started my IT career working as an IT Support Specialist Contractor for Apple, Inc. in 2018. I quickly feel in love with problem solving and learning the intricacies of how technology works. That lead me to completing a 3 month long full time bootcamp in 2020 with the goal of becoming CompTIA A+ certified. After completion, my eyes widen to the possibilities the Tech industry had to offer. I've worked in a few roles that offered the most learning potential - from both private and public sectors. My superpower always lead me to positions providing customer-facing support as I derive great pleasure from helping non-technical people. However, I never found myself in a role dynamic enough to utilize the broad range of skills I've acquired. That is until I stumbled upon Site Reliability Engineering - introduced to me by a Senior SRE. Now I spend my days honing my skillset under the direction of Senior SREs and building resilient systems using code.
